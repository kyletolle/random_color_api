# random_color_api

An API that generates hex random colors. Check out the demo at https://kyletolle-random-color-api.deno.dev/.

This is a Deno app, developed on Gitpod, and run on Deno Deploy.

## Installing

Developed with [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/). Sign up for a free account there and then link it to your GitHub account. Opening a workspace from this repo will take care of installing Deno!

## Running

Within the Gitpod workspace, You can run the code locally by running the following in the terminal

```
deno task start
```

When VS Code prompts you that a service is available on port 8000, click `Open Preview`. This opens a `Simple Browser` window in VS Code to show you the site and it'll allow you to refresh the page after each change to see those changes.

## Developing

Make sure the Deno extension is installe and enabled. That'll help with autocomplete while you write code. Since the deno run command is watching the file changes, you can refresh the page after each change to see the progress you're making.

## Deploying

Go sign up for a free account at [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) and link it to your GitHub. Create a new project from the repo on GitHub (`main.ts` is the file Deno should run) and then Deno Deploy will take are of deploying every time you push code to the git repo. The deployments happen in under 10 seconds, so that's insane!
